        <h2>Target in India</h2>
        <p>At Target, we have a timeless purpose and a proven strategy. And that hasn’t happened by accident. Some of the best minds
           from diverse backgrounds come together at Target to redefine retail in an inclusive learning environment that values people 
           and delivers world-class outcomes.</p>
        <p>That winning formula is especially apparent in Bengaluru, where Target operates one of the most advanced Global Capabilities 
          Centers in the industry. Nearly every aspect of Target’s business is represented in Bengaluru, and a strong connection to HQ means 
          ideas and results flow seamlessly across the globe. The India team works of some of Target’s most important strategies – things 
          like AI, machine learning, in-house engineering, data science strategies, computer generated imagery and much more. The team is also 
          building the technology infrastructure that enables new ways for guests to shop: Order Pickup, Drive Up, 2-Day shipping and orders 
          delivered by Shipt™.</p>
        <p>Bengaluru’s influence on the business isn’t limited to technology. It includes marketers, architects, designers, writers, 
          videographers, as well as experts in supply chain, HR, finance and many other areas. Innovation and inspiration are at the heart 
          of everything we do, from our mature Target Accelerator Program to our one-of-a-kind internal Guest Experience Center. With a 
          high-performing ecosystem that mirrors our U.S headquarters, Target in India is uniquely positioned to solve important business 
          problems for Target, and the retail industry.</p>
        <p>Finally, we believe that everyone should work someplace they love. We’re known for a fun, diverse and inclusive culture; we’re 
          a company that gives back to our community; and we’ve been recognized as a top employer in India. We offer the stability of growth 
          in a mature organization, the pride of a much-loved brand, and the agility and excitement of a fast-paced innovative culture</p>
